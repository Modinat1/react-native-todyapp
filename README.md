# ðŸ“Œ TodyApp

A mobile application built with **Expo**, **React Native**, and **React Query** that allows users to create, view, and manage todos.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design choices or assumptions made

# Architecture

- API requests are structured into a services layer (using axios) and consumed through hooks with React Query for caching, fetching, and mutation.

- UI is built using Tailwind for faster and utility-first styling.

- All colors used are configured in the tailwind.config.ts file for consistency

- Navigation is handled by expo-router, and Tabs layout.

# State Management

- Query and mutation states (loading, error, success) are handled through React Query.

- Zustand is used for global state management

# Icons

- All icons are SVGs stored in /assets/svgs for consistency and scalability.

# Filtering

- Todos are filtered into In Progress and Completed categories.
