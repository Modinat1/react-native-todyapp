# ðŸ“Œ TodyApp

A mobile application built with **Expo**, **React Native**, and **React Query** that allows users to create, view, and manage todos.  
The app features a **tab-based navigation** layout, todo filtering, and a clean, minimal UI styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   - git clone https://github.com/Modinat1/react-native-todyapp.git
   - cd react-native-todyapp
   - npm install
   - npx expo start

## ðŸŽ¨ Design choices or assumptions made

# Architecture

- API requests are structured into a services layer (using axios) and consumed through hooks with React Query for caching, fetching, and mutation.

- UI is built using Tailwind for faster and utility-first styling.

- All colors used are configured in the tailwind.config.ts file for consistency

- Navigation is handled by expo-router, and Tabs layout.

# State Management

- Query and mutation states (loading, error, success) are handled through React Query.

- Zustand is used for global state management

# Icons

- All icons are SVGs stored in /assets/svgs for consistency and scalability.

# Filtering

- Todos are filtered into In Progress and Completed categories.

- when the settings icon on this page is clicked, it navigates to the settings page, showing the user's data from the Api

# Challenges

- DummyJSON api does not align with the figma UI design
- I could not get the todos I created, because of that, hence the getting of todos with the color theme could not take effect
- I could only get sample todos from the api, not the ones created from the todo apo frontend
